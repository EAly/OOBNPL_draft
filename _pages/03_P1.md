This is the first pattern and check "making things happen" to see if $\alpha$! or $$ y = \alpha + \beta x $$....

so this $$ y = \alpha + \beta $$ was rendered,

but this $ \alpha $ was not!

It is suggested to use $\vert$ or $$\vert$$ as the pipe ($|$) symbol.

This seems to work with some drawbacks!
